# Hiya, I'm Superbithious.

I'm a student majoring in Computer Science. I mess around with a bunch of programming languages, though I spend a lot of time writing in [Luau](https://luau.org/). 

As the head honcho behind Megastellar, I found game development to be a unique learning experience. I've learned much about gameplay mechanics, developing 2D/3D assets, handling UI/UX design, and much about programming itself through the development of various games.

I'm an eager learner and I spend great time building systems around the cool projects I stumble across. I'm excited to continue expanding my domain of expertise in the coming years. :)
